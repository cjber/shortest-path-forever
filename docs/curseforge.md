I wanted a proper "get me there" for WoW: Forever, so Shortest Path Forever finds the fastest way across the world. Shift-click a destination on the map, or pick a quest, and it joins walking paths, flight paths, boats, zeppelins, lifts, the Deeprun Tram, portals and your hearthstone or class teleports into one journey. Directions use the game's own waypoint marker, map pins and objective tracker, so it looks like it came with the game. Walking maps for Eastern Kingdoms, Kalimdor and Zephras Isle come in the same download.

Planning a journey from the map: the route settles, the next boat counts down in the tracker and the compass turns with you.

## Features

- **A journey from where you stand.** Walking paths go around walls, hills and water, and through tunnels. The planner uses the flight points you know and can walk you to an undiscovered flight master when that saves time. Boat waits count towards the arrival time.
- **Directions on the map and minimap.** Walking legs are round breadcrumb dots, transport legs have their own colours, and a waypoint pin marks your destination. The Group Finder spinner turns while a new journey is checked.
- **Guide, on with every journey.** The game's own waypoint marker leads you to the next boat, lift, flight master or your destination, or round each turn if you prefer. Click the Journey header to toggle it; right-click to show the destination or clear the journey. An optional compass marks your next turns, stop and destination.
- **Back to your corpse.** As a ghost, a red dotted path in your tombstone's colour leads back to your body, and your journey picks up again once you are alive.
- **Live departures.** Hover a dock on the world map or minimap to see where its boats go, and when they arrive and leave. Destination docks light up; click one to open the map at the other end. Nearby departures appear in the objective tracker; aboard a timed boat, it shows the next stop.
- **Lifts, trams and portals.** Landings and stations have their own countdowns. Portals show where they lead, and clicking one opens that map.
- **Schedules learned from real rides.** Ride once to sync a transport. Sightings are shared quietly with your guild, party and nearby players. Unsynced services say “no sighting yet”, and a journey shows their guessed wait as “leaves in about”.
- **Arrival alerts.** A banner, the ship's own bell and a flashing taskbar icon warn when your boat is due, for when you're AFK. Zeppelins sound their horn instead.

## Usage

Shift-click the world map or minimap to plan a journey. For a quest, choose **Plan journey** from its right-click menu in the quest log or objective tracker, or Shift-click its map marker. Completed quests route to their turn-in.

- `/path` opens settings, also under **Options → AddOns → Shortest Path Forever**.
- `/path perf` prints the addon's CPU time and memory use.
- `/path debug` enables a saved trace for reporting a ride that did not sync.

Every feature has its own switch in the settings, and the world map's filter menu hides each kind of pin and the other faction's routes.
