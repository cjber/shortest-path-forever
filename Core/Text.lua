-- table, Adventure Guide's three-line byte fold, Shortest Path's whitespace strip -- and they did not agree, so "dun
-- garok" found "Dûn Garok" in one addon and not in another. One fold and one ranking, here. Nothing else about a search
-- lives in this file: what a title is, which items are searched and in what order they are shown stay with the addon.

-- Latin-1's accented letters (UTF-8 \195\128-\195\191, U+00C0-U+00FF) folded to plain letters, upper and lower case
-- alike, so "dun garok" finds "Dûn Garok"; the ligatures spell out (ß ss, æ ae, þ th, and œ oe from Latin Extended-A).
-- The two signs (multiply, divide) stay. string.lower only handles ASCII, so the fold runs before it.

--   nil the title does not match: at least one query word appears nowhere in it
-- A query word without its neighbours is the common case ("garok" for "dûn garok"), and a query with several words must
-- match all of them ("garok dûn" is not a hit on "dûn morogh"). Both arguments are already folded: callers fold a name
-- once and reuse it across a list, and folding the query per item would defeat that.
