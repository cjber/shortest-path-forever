-- The client reports a player's position only as a 0-1 fraction of a zone map, so it arrives
-- coarse and a little late; refreshing every frame would replan for jitter nobody can see.
-- A refresh is therefore due on a throttle and only once the member has moved a visible
-- distance, and the replan itself is handed to the next quiet frame (tests/follow_bench.lua
-- has the numbers behind both choices).

-- cheapest one that still reads as following someone rather than trailing them.
