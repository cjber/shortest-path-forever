-- Our entries in the game's own menus (the world map's filter menu, the minimap's tracking menu) are added through
-- Menu.ModifyMenu, and the game runs each modifier every time it builds the menu: when the map opens and when the
-- menu opens. Each of ours runs behind two guards: it only ever gets a menu description (a table) to add to, and an
-- error in it is reported through ns.SafeCall instead of unwinding through Blizzard_Menu (#161).

-- `/path menutest map|nearby|both|off` leaves our world map filter menu entries out from the next /reload: an A/B
-- check for #161 that needs no file edits. "map" is the map filters, "nearby" the Nearby services submenu. It is
-- kept in ns.db.menuTest outside DEFAULTS, which holds only the settings page's options: a missing key reads as off.
