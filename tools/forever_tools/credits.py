"""Generate `Data/Credits.lua` and the store pages' thanks sentence from an addon's `THIRD_PARTY.md` (WFA-31, WFA-33).

The credits page in ForeverCore reads one file per addon, `ns.Credits`, and this is its only writer. Two explicit
sections carry the data, each a Markdown table `| Who | What | Notes |`:

    ## Players

    | Who | What | Notes |
    |---|---|---|
    | [Brainc3ll](https://github.com/Brainc3ll) | The French translation | |
    | Someone | Reported the tracker drift (#99) | |

    ## Inspired by

    | Who | What | Notes |
    |---|---|---|
    | Questie | The objective-tracker layout | |

Rows are taken as written; nothing is guessed from their text. Each row is one shipped contribution (one report fixed,
one idea built, one translation, one code change), so a player with five shipped items has five rows with the same
`Who`, in table order; `Data/Credits.lua` keeps every one of them. A Markdown backslash escape before ASCII punctuation
becomes the plain character, as CommonMark says, so `Sol\\_Deus` and `Sol_Deus` name one player. In `Who`, a Markdown
link keeps only its visible text. In `What`, links are reduced to their text and issue references such as `(#99)` or
`(cjber/x#12, #3)` are removed, so the in-game line reads cleanly. `Notes` is for the reader of the file and never
reaches the game. A section that is missing is an empty list, and the addon's author is never listed (WFA-33).

A name in `credits_opt_out.txt`, beside this module, is one a player asked not to be credited under (WFA-33). The run
fails with the offending `## Players` row rather than writing a file that would name them.

The same run writes one sentence, "Thanks to A, B and everyone who reported a bug or asked for a feature.", between
`<!-- forever-credits:start -->` and `<!-- forever-credits:end -->` in `README.md` (inside its `## Credits`) and
`docs/curseforge.md`, listing every `## Players` name once, in rank order: most rows first, then table order. The
markers use `forever_tools.family`'s handling. A file without the markers is left alone, except that `--check` fails a
`README.md` without them.

Run it from the addon's root after editing `THIRD_PARTY.md`, and add `Data\\Credits.lua` to the TOC:

    python3 tools/forever_tools/credits.py            # write Data/Credits.lua and both blocks
    python3 tools/forever_tools/credits.py --check    # fail when the file or a block is stale

The addon passes the table to `ForeverCore.Credits.Register("The Addon's Title", ns.Credits)` once it loads.
